xk6-top `v0.2.1` is here ðŸŽ‰!

`v0.2.1` is a maintenance release, it does not contain new features.
The purpose of the release is to adapt to protocol changes.

From xk6-dashboard v0.7.3, the SSE protocol aggregate events have been optimized. This is an incompatible change that is addressed in this release. Older xk6-top versions do not work with newer xk6-dashboard (and k6) versions.
