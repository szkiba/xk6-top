### Metrics dashboard

The xk6-top extension now utilizes the SSE stream of the k6 web-dashboard and implements a terminal-based metrics dashboard functionality.

In addition to the detailed results of the thresholds evaluations, the dashboard contains all metric aggregates in tabular form as well as graphs of the most important metrics.

### Remote k6 support

The k6top CLI tool can display external (even remote) k6 process metrics on a terminal-based dashboard. It is not necessary to include the xk6-top extension in the external k6 process.
